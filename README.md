# Software Design Patterns

I recently ran a small workshop about [software design patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612), and I had a few examples for some of the most common patterns.  I felt pretty comfortable with the presentation overall, but there were many details I had to gloss over for the sake of time.  Thus, I thought I'd write up a few articles exploring [these patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), using a simple prime kata to illustrate my points.
